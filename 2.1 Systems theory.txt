The public case that I chose was a retailer selling my personal information to others for profit. And the ethical quandaries that I chose to include were: Public Data leak, How the data is being used, and government data leaks. For my systems, I chose Society, Wiki Leaks, National Security, Credit Rating, Stock Market, and Ads. 


Public Data leak affects society because the data of millions of customers being leaked publicly will surely affect a lot of citizens and will lead to plenty of protests and panic. The public data might also affect Wikileaks as some sensitive/disturbing data about the general public might be leaked onto there. Public data would also greatly affect The Stock market as it would lead a lot of companies' stocks to crash as the public would have more distrust in such companies, not to mention the main retailer’s stock tanking. How the data is being used is also a big part as it might be used by other countries as a way to gain advantage over the United States. The data might also be used in such a way to scam customers and destroy their savings/credit. The data can definitely be used to promote targeted Ads as the retailer can target certain ads to certain populations and even push some products/political opinions. Even the leaking of sensitive government employees information would greatly affect national security as it would weaken the United States, giving other nations an advantage. It would also leak some government information to Wikileaks. Finally, Government data would also affect us a society as we would lose faith in the current government and cause distrust between the common citizen and government.
